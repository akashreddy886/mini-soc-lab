Mini SOC Lab – Splunk SIEM (L1 SOC Analyst Project)
Project Summary

This project simulates a real-world L1 SOC monitoring environment using Splunk Enterprise as the SIEM platform.

The lab was built to:

Monitor Windows security logs

Detect brute-force attempts

Identify suspicious login activity

Create alerts based on defined thresholds

Perform basic incident investigation workflow

The environment replicates how an L1 SOC Analyst monitors authentication-based threats in an enterprise network.

Lab Environment
Infrastructure

SIEM Server: Ubuntu – Splunk Enterprise

Victim Machine: Windows 10

Attacker Machine: Kali Linux

Log Forwarding: Splunk Universal Forwarder

Log Flow
Kali Linux (Attacker)
        ↓
Windows 10 (Victim – RDP Enabled)
        ↓
Splunk Universal Forwarder
        ↓
Splunk Enterprise (SIEM)

Windows Security and System logs were forwarded to Splunk in real time.

Configuration Overview
Data Collection

Configured inputs.conf on Windows:

[WinEventLog://Security]
disabled = 0
index = wineventlog

[WinEventLog://System]
disabled = 0
index = wineventlog

Configured outputs.conf:

[tcpout]
defaultGroup = splunk_indexer

[tcpout:splunk_indexer]
server = <Splunk_Server_IP>:9997

Splunk receiver was enabled on port 9997.

Use Case 1 – RDP Brute Force Detection
Attack Simulation

Used Hydra from Kali Linux to perform an RDP brute-force attack against Windows 10.

Detection – Failed Logins

Event ID: 4625

Logon Type: 10 (RemoteInteractive – RDP)

index=wineventlog EventCode=4625 Logon_Type=10
| stats count by Account_Name, Source_Network_Address
| sort - count
Observation

Multiple failed login attempts detected

Same source IP generating high number of failures

Targeting a single user account

This triggered brute-force suspicion.

Use Case 2 – Successful Login Detection

Event ID: 4624

Logon Type: 10

index=wineventlog EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=10
Observation

Successful login detected from same attacker IP

Correlated with prior 4625 failures

Indicates compromised credentials

Use Case 3 – New User Creation Monitoring

Event ID: 4720

index=wineventlog EventCode=4720

Monitored for unauthorized account creation (Persistence attempt).

Use Case 4 – Password Reset Monitoring

Event ID: 4723, 4724

index=wineventlog (EventCode=4723 OR EventCode=4724)

Used to detect potential account manipulation activity.

Alert Configuration (L1 SOC Level)

Configured real-time alerts for:

More than 5 failed login attempts from same IP within 5 minutes

Successful login after multiple failures

New account creation

Password reset activity

Alert Severity

Medium – Multiple failed logins

High – Successful login after brute force

High – Unauthorized account creation

Investigation Workflow (L1 SOC Process)

When alert triggered:

Reviewed Event ID and Logon Type

Identified source IP address

Checked number of failed attempts

Verified if successful login occurred

Correlated timestamps

Escalated as confirmed brute-force compromise

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Technique	ID	Description
Brute Force	T1110	Repeated password attempts
Valid Accounts	T1078	Successful credential usage
Create Account	T1136	Persistence mechanism
Dashboard Panels Created

Failed Login Trend

Top Source IPs by Login Failures

Successful RDP Logins

New User Creations

Password Changes

Authentication Activity Timeline

Detection Outcome

During simulation:

20+ failed RDP login attempts detected

Successful login identified from attacker IP

Clear correlation between brute-force attempts and account compromise

Alerts triggered as expected
